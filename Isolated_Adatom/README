These are the codes to calculate the self-consistent ground state and 
the spin excitation spectrum of isolated adatoms adsorbed to an infinite
substrate. Although they feature parameters related to the number of
adatoms, their values must be set to one in this version of the codes.
The version for a general number of adatoms is under development.
